/**
 * The quests module allows staff to create new server quests with rewards attached.
 * Rewards can either be in-game items, or tokens.
 * /
 * Quests can have types of either
 * - solo: In which the objective can only really be completed by 1 player
 * - shared: in which it's a team / server-wide effort to complete the quest
 * /
 * Depending on the quest type, rewards are handed out
 * - solo: in a logarithmic fashion. So if there were 10 the winner would get 50% of the reward, 2nd place would get 20%, 3rd 10% and so on
 * - shared: each participant gets an equal rewards, split across the total participants
